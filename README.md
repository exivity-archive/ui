A collection of components to build interfaces.

NOTE: This repository is read-only (for now)
--------------------------------------------

Because of some DX optimisations at Exivity, we're marking this repository as
read-only for the time being (we've moved all development efforts on this
codebase to a private monorepo).

While we plan to release a stable v1 version of this package with an open
source license again, we don't have a timeline for this.

Do you have experience combining private and public repositories while
benefiting from a monorepo setup? We're hiring! ðŸ˜‰ https://exivity.com/careers/
