# Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.

Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

I call it luck. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? As you wish.

## Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I call it luck. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

### You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. As you wish.

I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? As you wish. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!
