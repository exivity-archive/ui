Todo
----

- More components
- Better docs
- Kitchen sink demo
- Default stories should have knobs for all propTypes
- Import/export all reakit components, so end-users won't ever have to use reakit directly
- Better stories (introduction, example code, propTypes, remove or replace withInfo?)
- Option to embed fonts instead of loading through Google Fonts (for offline use)
- Upgrade code to use styled-components as soon as reakit upgrades
- ~~Use https://reakit.io/ because it's awesome~~
